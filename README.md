### chasing sōsuke -- wavedash

**hook:**

making coldplay<br>
carry- okay<br>
faking- olé<br>
chasing...<br>

making coldplay<br>
carry- okay<br>
faking- olé<br>
chasing Sōsuke<br>

on a wave...<br>
dashing on a wave...<br>
dashing on them...<br>
dashing on a wave...<br>

on a wave...<br>
dashing on a wave...<br>
dashing on them...<br>
dashing on a wave...<br>

**verse:**

what a game<br>
spent the whole day throwing<br>
and he didnt even know it<br>
so i had to let him hold it<br>

what a save<br>
from the front to the back<br>
what a play<br>
i dont front, i dont act<br>
on the game<br>
i'm just...<br>

**hook:**

making coldplay<br>
carry- okay<br>
faking- olé<br>
chasing...<br>

making coldplay<br>
carry- okay<br>
faking- olé<br>
chasing Sōsuke<br>

on a wave...<br>
dashing on a wave...<br>
dashing on them...<br>
dashing on a wave...<br>

on a wave...<br>
dashing on a wave...<br>
dashing on them...<br>
dashing on a wave...<br>
